don't allow dragging/resizing beyond image bounds
allow naming the cropped areas
store metadata in cropped images (?)
	tried to store jpeg comment but Qt doesn't support that apparently
show Qt version/library location in about box
Settings singleton for preferences

ideas
-----
user can select a "white" pixel; then use flood fill to find the rest of such areas, then use "curve fitting" technique to fit rectangles
incorporate scanning directly
recognize a distinctive pattern on the scanner lid (stipple?) where photos are not, for boundary detection

deferred
--------
while dragging bottom handles, control key to constrain to even angle (but that's not very useful)
nudge handle while mouse is held down over it (arrows) (but the magnified corner views are good enough for fine adjustment)

done
----
next/previous navigation through a set of images (given on command line, or with a mask in cwd) and load relevant templates if that feature is selected in preferences
loading template loads the "original" image too, if not already loaded (preference?)
some actual image processing!
command arg for image to load
save crop positions to text or XML file
zoom
rotate selection 90 degrees
delete rect
pan
drag to move
make handles bigger
zoom to fit entire image, width or selection
